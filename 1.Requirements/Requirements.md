# Introduction

The present world is nothing without the word electricity. Every house, office, shopping mall and other building need eletricity for their electrical appliances. The power that is required for every one will be transmitted to them from the generating stations and sub-stations through transmission lines. "Transmision lines play a vital role in power transmission". It is very important to select the appropriate transmission line to reduce losses. This project helps to check whether the choosen transmission line with specified parameters is feasible or not. And also helps to ckeck the feasibility of choosen voltage value for power transmission and also gives detailed analysis of various losses.

# History

Mathematical analysis of the behaviour of electrical transmission lines grew out of the work of James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and Oliver Heaviside. In 1855 Lord Kelvin formulated a diffusion model of the current in a submarine cable. The model correctly predicted the poor performance of the 1858 trans-Atlantic submarine telegraph cable. In 1885 Heaviside published the first papers that described his analysis of propagation in cables and the modern form of the telegrapher's equations.

# Features
- To check whether the selected transmision line is efficient for tranmission of power through it. 
- To check whether the considered voltage and current values are feasible or not to run the power through the selected transmission line.
- Gives the detailed analysis of the transmission line like voltage regulation, efficiency and various losses(including corona losses, I2R losses) of the transmission line.

# Swot Analysis
## Strengths
- Easy to use and Implement
- Helps the customer for choosing transmission line with appropriate parameters
- Helps the customer to check the feasibility of assumed input parameters like voltage
## Weaknesses
- Inputs should be given manually
- Customers should have minimum knowledge towards power systems
## Opportunities 
- The program can be further developed based on the required parameter needed by the customers
## Threats
- Parameters of the transmission line shouls be done carefully otherwise, hazardeous situation should be faced.
